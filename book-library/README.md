This project is my capstone project for the ALX Front-End Web Development course.

I chose to build a book library using HMTL, CSS, ReactJs, and Tailwind CSS.

This is a basic Library which uses the Open Library API to search for books and access details about the books.

Find attached the links to the deployed site and the Figma file to view the design and prototype.
